- **THESE NOTEBOOKS** — Stalogy 365. One for lists, one for sketching. The grid is perfect.
- **A MEAL IN OAXACA** — Mole negro at a place with no sign. Still thinking about it.
- **THIS ALBUM ON REPEAT** — Nils Frahm, Music for Animals. Three hours of quiet focus.
- **A CHAIR I CAN'T STOP LOOKING AT** — Jean Prouve Standard Chair. The engineering is the ornament.
